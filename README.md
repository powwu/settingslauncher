# SettingsLauncher

A simple Android app that redirects the user to the settings app. Used for devices whose default launchers have a modified settings section instead of the native android version.

**You can download an apk [here](https://github.com/powwu/SettingsLauncher/actions/runs/16231486297/artifacts/3517079022), but you'll need to sign it yourself.** If you're not sure how to do this, there are apps available that can do it for you (search apk signer).
